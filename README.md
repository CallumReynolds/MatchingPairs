# MatchingPairs
My terrible matching pair game.
A very simple matching pair game with no advanced features. Built as a small project to test my skills and see if I could develop a simple web based game. 
How to play: It's simple, the 'game' will load and you will see all the images for only a short amount of time, your job is to then try and remember where all the images are match them up by clicking on the image fields. Clicking on an image field will display the image and then you have to click on another field, if the images are the same, that's one pair matched, if they aren't the images aren't not matched and you have to try again and find the right pair. Once all the pairs have been matched, that's it! It will tell you how many tries it took you and a button will display allowing you to reset the game and play again.
Note: This version is not supported for viewing on mobile and tablet devices. (It will display on the devices but will be displayed incorrectly)
Feel free to fork and mess around with the source code!
